# Gemini CLI Configuration for edgartools Repository

## **Purpose:**
This `GEMINI.md` file is designed to help a non-Python programmer, who is familiar with general programming concepts (like variables, loops, functions, data structures, etc.), understand the `edgartools` Python library. The explanations should be clear, concise, and focused on the "what" and "why" rather than deep Python syntax unless absolutely necessary.

## **Target Audience Profile:**
* **Familiarity:** Understands general programming paradigms, command-line interfaces, data manipulation concepts (e.g., tables, fields), and the purpose of APIs.
* **Python Experience:** Limited to none.
* **Learning Goal:** To quickly grasp the core functionality of `edgartools` and apply it to retrieve and process financial data.

## **Explanation Guidelines:**

1.  **Conciseness:** Keep explanations brief but informative. Avoid jargon where possible.
2.  **Concept Prioritization:** When a Python-specific concept (e.g., "class," "method," "decorator," "context manager") is encountered, provide a **brief, high-level explanation** in the context of `edgartools`. For example, for "class," explain it as a "blueprint for creating objects that have specific data and actions."
3.  **Analogy Usage:** Use simple analogies if they aid understanding without oversimplifying.
4.  **Focus on "What It Does" and "Why It's Useful":** For functions and modules, prioritize explaining their purpose and benefits rather than their internal implementation details.
5.  **Assumed Knowledge:** Assume familiarity with basic data concepts like "tables," "rows," "columns," "fields," and the general idea of an API for fetching data.

## **Structured Output Preference:**
Responses should be structured for easy readability. Use:
* **Headings and Subheadings:** To organize information.
* **Bullet Points:** For lists of features, steps, or explanations.
* **Code Blocks:** For example code, clearly distinguished.
* **Bold Text:** For emphasis on key terms.
* **Clear Paragraphs:** For explanations.

## **Specific Concepts to Explain Briefly (On First Encounter):**

* **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects (like `Company`, `Filing`).
* **Object/Instance:** A specific item created from a class (e.g., `my_company = Company("AAPL")`).
* **Method:** A function that belongs to a class or object (e.g., `company.get_filings()`).
* **Function:** A block of reusable code.
* **Module/Package:** A file or collection of files containing Python code.
* **JSON:** A common data format (explain it as a structured way to represent data, often like a dictionary or list).
* **API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules that allows software to communicate with other software (e.g., `edgartools` uses SEC APIs).
* **Dataframe (Pandas):** A table-like data structure (like a spreadsheet) for organizing and manipulating data.

## **Example Learning Path for `edgartools` Functions (Incremental Difficulty):**

When asked to provide examples, follow this progression. **Do not provide all at once, only when prompted for examples or learning paths.**

### **Example 1: Basic Company Information Retrieval (Easy)**
* **Goal:** Fetch and display basic information about a company.
* **Focus:** Introduction to the `Company` class and basic attribute access.
* **Illustrates:**
    * Importing from `edgartools`.
    * Instantiating a `Company` object.
    * Accessing simple properties like `name`, `cik`, `ticker`.

### **Example 2: Retrieving Recent Filings (Medium)**
* **Goal:** Get a list of recent SEC filings for a company.
* **Focus:** Using a method that returns a collection of data, and potentially iterating through it or accessing specific elements.
* **Illustrates:**
    * Using the `get_filings()` method.
    * Accessing attributes of individual `Filing` objects (e.g., `form`, `date`, `accession_number`).
    * Simple looping or indexing.

### **Example 3: Extracting Data from a Specific Filing (More Challenging)**
* **Goal:** Extract specific financial data (e.g., from an income statement or balance sheet) from a particular filing.
* **Focus:** Deepening into filing content, potentially using `get_data()` or similar methods, and understanding how data is structured within filings.
* **Illustrates:**
    * Selecting a specific filing.
    * Using methods like `get_income_statement()` or `get_balance_sheet()`.
    * Introduction to Pandas DataFrames (if returned) and basic DataFrame manipulation (e.g., displaying the head).
    * The concept of structured vs. unstructured data within filings.

## **Repository Understanding Directives:**
* Thoroughly analyze all Python files (`.py`) within the cloned `edgartools` repository.
* Understand the relationships between modules, classes, and functions.
* Prioritize understanding the public API of the library (functions and classes intended for users).
* When a query refers to a specific part of the code, refer to the actual code for the most accurate explanation.
